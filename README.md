Playground for django web developmnet

Here is where I tested and build web applications with python's django web framework, using a Postgres database.Starting to build more javascript into it using react and d3. 

Apps build:
1) Bible verse for moods. 
2) EOQ formula based on data from a form and excel spreadsheet. 
3) Web page for different youtube videos for different moods. 
4) Books I've read and lessons that I've learned from each of those books. 
5) Fitness tracker that tracks my daily weights and workouts.
